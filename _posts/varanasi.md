Varanasi, also known as Benares, stands as India's spiritual capital. The city's ghats come alive at dawn as pilgrims and priests perform ancient rituals along the Ganges. The narrow lanes of the old city tell stories that span millennia.

The evening Ganga Aarti ceremony at Dashashwamedh Ghat offers a spectacular display of devotion and tradition. Brass lamps sway in synchronized motion as Sanskrit chants fill the air, creating an atmosphere that hasn't changed for centuries.
