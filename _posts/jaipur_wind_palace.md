The Hawa Mahal, or Palace of Winds, rises five stories high in the heart of Jaipur's old city. Built in 1799, this architectural marvel combines Hindu Rajput architecture with Islamic Mughal elements, creating a unique masterpiece in pink sandstone.

The palace's distinctive honeycomb facade, featuring 953 small windows decorated with intricate latticework, allows cool air to flow through the building, creating a natural air conditioning system that was revolutionary for its time.
